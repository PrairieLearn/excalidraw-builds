  # Ensure that we only run one concurrent job for Pull Requests. This ensures
  # that someone can't kill our throughput by pushing a bunch of commits to a
  # single branch in rapid succession.
  #
  # However, for master builds, we allow maximum concurrency. This is achieved
  # because `github.head_ref` isn't defined there, and `github.run_id` is
  # globally unique in this repo.
